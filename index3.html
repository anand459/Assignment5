        Undefined: It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a space in memory will
        contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.

        Not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses
        the variable which is not inside the memory heap.
